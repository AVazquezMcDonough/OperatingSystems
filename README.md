# OperatingSystems

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a gaming company that wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms. Their current game, Draw It or Lose It, is currently only available as an Android app. The job we were given at Creative Technology Solutions, was to make this game available for multiple platforms, not just solely Android.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel as though I did well with taking the information given from the company and using it to complete the template efficiently. I feel as though I did well with the evaluation portion of the document. This is where I scored the highest. I did well with describing the advantages, weaknesses, and characteristics of each operating system when it comes to the server side, client side, and development tools. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document helped me plan out the code. All of this information being found in this one document kept me on track of the requirements and all relevant information I needed to develop the code.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could go back, I would improve the section where I filled out the design constraints and executive summary. I noticed these sections were missing important details so I would go back and fix those.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by making sure we have a game that is secure and functional. It is important to consider the user’s needs because this program is designed for their use. The user is why we create the program in the first place. The program’s success will rely on the user’s satisfaction. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I looked at the information I was given and planned everything out as a means of approaching designing the software. In the future, I will be sure to use flowcharts as well as pseudocode to design software. Planning makes the execution more successful.
